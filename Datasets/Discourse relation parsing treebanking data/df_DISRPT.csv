0,"limitations of multilingual models as weak learners and showed that larger models with richer pre-training objectives, in the form of instruction fine-tuning, yield more meaningful representations. post-processing refinement logic improves lowresource relation classification, as evidenced by the consistent outperformance of discoflan+ref over the baseline model. it addresses issues of mismatches caused by generation problems, leading to enhanced classification accuracy. our findings highlight the potential of augmenting weak label learners with distributional logic to improve model classification. discoflan showcases instruction finetuning for multilingual discourse relation classification for the disrpt 2023 shared task and provides valuable insights for future research in this area. we recognize the potential of larger models to improve prediction quality; however, due to constraints in terms of resources and time, we were unable to test the performance of flan-t5-large in our study. furthermore, we acknowledge that further advancements in decoding strategies and imporved prompts have the potential to enhance label representations and generation. in our future work, we intend to explore these topics to enhance our current models. limitations while using the majority label solves the problem of handing out-of-vocabulary labels during fine-tuning, we acknowledge that label refinement method relies on the majority label. this makes a strong assumption about our dataset bias, namely, that the majority label outnumbers the rest of the labels significantly to impact accuracy. hence, this method may not be applicable to well-balanced datasets. we also note that simply predicting the majority label is simple method of label prediction which does not generalized to new unseen datasets. improving label prediction by enriching datasets manually or automatically might make the task more representative of natural data. using larger models can improve model prediction however due to time and machine constraints we leave the evaluation using flant5-large for future work."
