0,"When a dictionary for a low-resource language lacks a word, but has several related ones in terms of synonymy or semantic similarity, it is a definite benefit to be able to provide those to the dictionary user instead of merely saying, “No results found.” However, there are some potential drawbacks here: for example, this could increase the rate at which words acquire connotations by analogy with English. ‘Locomotive’ and ‘train’ are closely related concepts in English; but that does not necessarily hold for every language, and there is some risk in implying that it does.
Language instructors will be all too familiar with students using tools like Google Translate to do their homework for them instead of doing the hard work of learning the language. On a larger scale, Google Translate itself was formerly available as a free service that software developers could use to do automated machine translation in bulk; this was abruptly discontinued in 2011. Industry rumour7 held that the bulk service was being used to generate so much of the parallel text appearing on the internet—parallel text needed to train machine translation models—that those models could no longer improve sufficiently if they continued to inadvertently be fed primarily their own outputs. This highlights the possible risk that applying machine learning tools like word embeddings can end up distorting language. To this end, we believe that the use of word embeddings to provide analogous words to dictionary users is beneficial, but does not and cannot replace actual lexicography.

1,"limitations one limitation of this work is the lack of a more comprehensive study of langid methods, which could impact slightly the results. another limitation is the number of non-bil languages, which can be increased to more than 1,000 languages with the datasets proposed in (brown, 2014). furthermore, the use of wikipedia data limits the search of samples, since all pages are supposedly written in portuguese. so, relying on a broader set can bring a more realistic estimate on the in-the-wild search for data. in addition, a major limitation of this work is the lack of inspection of the results with native speakers. we are already engaging with one mbya guarani community, but it is quite difficult to extend such engagement to other communities."
2,"limitations the fst does not yet have an extensive coverage of the lushootseed vocabulary, so it does not work on all domains of text. also, writing an fst takes a lot of time and requires special knowledge of the language. the neural model is limited to nouns only, but it can work on out-of-vocabulary words unlike the fst, however, we have only tested its accuracy using the words that are known to the fst, which means that words that follow very different inflection patterns will, most likely, not be analyzed correctly. furthermore, the neural model was not trained on derivational morphology, which means that word derivations might also result in erroneous predictions."
3,"limitations although improving the performance of our embedding methods is desirable, the most apparent limitation of our work is not the overall quality of representations produced, but rather the range of words our methodologies can be applied to. currently, our methodology can only be used to construct word embeddings for dictionary headwords. this represents a considerable limitation, as wolastoqey and mi’kmaq are both polysyntheic languages, in which speakers often build new words by creatively combining roots. as this is the case, no dictionary is expected to contain definitions for all word-forms of these languages. because of this, future work is required to extend our approach to construct embeddings for words that do not appear in a bilingual dictionary."
4,"limitations this work focuses on using computational tools to determine dialect based on a small quantity of writings of a spoken language, using a writing system that was adapted recently, rather than one that evolved alongside the language for thousands of years. this limitation in orthography leads to differences in character usage, frequently between dialects (which is helpful for this problem), but there is also variation also within dialects depend- ing on the author. for example, different writers will use different methods of transcribing a nasal sound; eastern tends to use nh for nasal sounds in the middle of a word, although some writers will use a capital n. southwestern anishinaabemowin tends to use ny, ns or nz for these same nasal sounds within words. as noted by valentine (2001b), there are variations in language within dialects, including age-stratified language proficiency, where older speakers tend to be more fluent than younger ones, largely due to differences in opportunities to learn the language. these differences might be detected and interpreted as dialect differences if the diversity in writers is not comparable between the two sets of texts being compared. additionally, an individual’s word choice may change depending on their gender or occupation (valentine, 2001b), and having only a small sample of writings does not allow us to capture these differences well. to test how much our model is learning author preferences over dialects, using some writings from authors not included in the training data would provide some insight. future work could do a better job of tracking authorship between cross validation folds as well as sourcing from a wider set of writers. only small quantities of text were used for each dialect, which was limiting in terms of methods that could be used. the methods utilized in this paper could be easily applied to minority languages that do not have large quantities of written text available, of course, with permission from and in collaboration with indigenous language keepers. our future work could involve the collection of larger quantities of text, which would allow the use of a wider range of language analysis. ethical statement some of the texts used for our samples were transcribed aadizookaanan, a type of traditional story highly revered by ojibwe. these particular stories are not to be spoken out loud during non-winter months without snow on the ground. there are particular spiritual reasons for this, and unfortunate things can happen to individuals telling or hearing these stories when there is no nearby snow. therefore, we will not write out the stories here and we strongly encourage citation followers to heed precaution. for more information, bring your tobacco and questions to a trusted anishinaabe knowledge keeper. indigenous peoples have experienced a long his- tory of colonialism, including by well-meaning researchers. please remember that indigenous peoples must maintain sovereignty over their languages, traditional stories, and other knowledge. all research involving indigenous knowledge, including that for the development of generative ai, should be done ethically in reciprocal relationships with indigenous peoples. the research should also meet their needs and wants, as described by the given indigenous peoples (smith, 2021)."
5,"limitations in this work we explored transfer learning approaches only by using pretrained word embeddings. transfer learning should be explored further. some of the segmentation methods have their own hyperparameters which are usually obtained for high-resourced languages and might be suboptimal in our case. these hyperparameters should be systematically explored. finally, token-free pretrained models fine-tuned on our data should be investigated. it is costly and difficult to acquire human translations, due to the limited number of speakers and exclusive lrl communities; moreover, the fact that we are not wayúunaiki speakers limited our qualitative assessment."
6,"limitations. – mbart50 - is a multilingual sequenceto-sequence model pre-trained using the multilingual denoising pre-training objective (tang et al., 2020). hyper-parameters - for the transformer approach we tokenized the source and target parallel sentences into subword tokens using byte pair encoding (bpe) (gage, 1994). the bpe representation was chosen in order to remove vocabulary overlap during dataset combinations. for other approaches we applied the tokenizer of each model, table 3 shows hyper-parameters used in our baseline experiments."
7,"limitation indicates that the transformer model’s performance is highly dependent on the availability of extensive parallel corpora for effective machine translation. on the other hand, the transfer learning approach showed more promising results for low-resource indigenous languages. we observed that models pretrained on high-resource languages, such as spanish, and fine-tuned on the indigenous languages improved translation quality. however, even with transfer learning, the performance was not satisfactory, and there were errors that persisted across all three approaches. the general error that all three approaches failed to address adequately was the translation of domain-specific and culturally specific terms in mazatec and mixtec. these languages have unique vocabulary and cultural nuances that require a deeper understanding and context to ensure accurate translation. the limited availability of domain-specific parallel corpora for these languages hampered the models’ ability to capture and translate such terms effectively."
8,"limitations this paper’s aim is to give an introduction to researchers, students, of interested community indigenous community members to the topic of machine translation for indigenous languages of the americas. therefore, this paper is not an in-depth survey of the literature on indigenous languages nor a more technical survey of low-resource machine translation. we would point the reader to more specific surveys on these aspects (haddow et al., 2022; mager et al., 2018b). ethical statement we could not find any specific ethical issue for this paper or potential danger. nevertheless, we want to point to the reader that working with indigenous languages (in this case, mt) implies a set of ethical questions that are important to handle. for a deeper understanding of the matter, we suggest specialized literature to the reader (mager et al., 2023; bird, 2020; schwartz, 2022)."
9,"limitations one major limitation of the current methodology is its predication on the existence of a recorded lexicon in some form that can be ported into an online format. this approach may not be ideal as a framework for the development of a new dictionary, as its express goal is to increase accessibility to existing resources and facilitate the expansion of those resources. additionally, the development of a bespoke, dependency-free web-application for showcasing existing resources is likely low on the list of viable strategies for a community-led reclamation effort, especially if there are no community members already familiar with web-development. any replication of the work described here is more suited for a group with a set of existing resources, access to developers, and a need to quickly get those resources into the hands of community members. the other primary limitation of this tool and its development methodology in its current form is the potential lack of accessibility in the types of communities for which it is intended. despite the increase in access to internet-capable smart devices in communities such as that on st. lawrence island, in many such places, the availability of reliable wireless internet access remains relatively low. users are often forced to use expensive cellular data plans to conduct any amount of web-browsing. while the ultimate vision for this dictionary is for it to be packaged in a downloadable, offline format, replications of the tool in its current live-web implementation may leave many people unable to use it with the frequency that they would like. though this is certainly a limiting factor in the effectiveness of this tool, the deployment of an offline version of the dictionary remains a preeminent goal of the project. akuzipik dictionary website https://bhunt6.github.io/ akuzipigestun-sangaawa akuzipik dictionary code https://github.com/bhunt6/ akuzipigestun-sangaawa"
