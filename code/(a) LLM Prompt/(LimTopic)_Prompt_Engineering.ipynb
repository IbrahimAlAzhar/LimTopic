for reclaimed speech and for tweets with aave.However, because previous work has found that word choice and profanity are likely stronger contributors to bias against aave than linguistic features of aave , we hope that bias mitigation techniques at the keyword level can also help alleviate bias against aave without the use of sensitive racial or dialect classifiers.our methodology is helpful for detecting the most widespread and prevalent problems.However, there may be other serious problems that do not receive the same amount of traffic that still deserve attention.Thus, relying on frameworks that focus on bigger segments of the population poses the risk of missing important harms to smaller communities.In this work, we develop a list of keywords for bias'}, {'Title': '.5 performs considerably better than gpt-3 in answering factual questions', 'Summary': 'about object location changes.for other tasks for which pretraining on code seems to be beneficial.Establish a fully causal link between entity tracking capacities and high performance on our task.Entity tracking is a high-level linguistic behavior and many other capacities are necessary for achieving high accuracy on our task.Therefore, we cannot rule out that differences in some other capacity, such as interpreting sentences compositionally , are the main driver for the differences in behavior we see across models.A possible criticism of our setup is that it requires short-term memory capacities that exceed the memory capacities of most, if not all, humans.That is, if we presented humans with the same input as the model, we would not expect them to be able to keep track of the contents of all 7 boxes due to memory limitations.Therefore we are potentially expecting models to do super-human entity tracking, a setup that has been criticized for model evaluations of other linguistic abilities.We nevertheless believe that our task is justified given the architecture of the evaluated'},

pabee-bert-base under are summarized in table 7.even constrained with a very low modification rate, e., 3%, both variants of same can still significantly reduce the model’s efficiency.In addition, with increasing modification rate, same leads to higher reduction in efficiency.Ablation study: to understand the inner mechanism of same, we conduct ablation studies on each component.As shown in table 8, solely using heuristic loss can already lead to significant effi- ciency drop.In addition, using loss combination, and adding layer-wise importance weights can both further increase the high

takeaways of our results below.Number of chatbots the generalizability of our metric analysis results is constrained by the fact that we were only able to include conversations from 4 chatbots in our analyses.We did our best to choose chatbots representative of the field and seem to have selected a fairly diverse group of models.However, it is possible that not all results we found in our metric analyses will generalize when evaluating other chat models.One possible example is the number of partner contradictions we observed among our 4 chatbots , which may be similar by coincidence.If other chatbot models indeed differ more substantially in partner contradiction rates, our sensitivity metric analysis may have underestimated the sensitivity of our partner contradiction metric.In general, including a larger number of chatbots in a metric analysis will improve the chance that its results will apply to new chatbot models.use of surgers as evaluators we perform our analyses using only'}, {'Title': 'As exciting as this work is, it does have several', 'Summary': 'limitations and a lot of opportunities for future improvement.How to scale? We demonstrated our method in a highly constrained environment with very limited concepts, whereas humans are able to pick up new concepts in the noisy world with few shots.How could these representations learned in a clean environment be useful in real world? Would comparative learning still be useful outside of the classroom? We followed the baby step of progressive alignment and hoping that establishing a set of clean base knowledge, can ease the acquisition of future more complex concepts through comparisons with existing knowledge, analogy and hierarchical abstraction.what about other words? Some concepts can be learned through just visual inputs, like color, whereas other concepts require grounding through different sensory types or modalities, like “hot”, “loud” and “fast”.Even more concepts are built upon existing words through abstraction and generalization, e.comparisons can still be used to ground these words, but input to these comparisons could vary from data modalities to computation methods, to abstract representations.how to put words into sentences?'}, {'Title': 'Ground truth and data cleaning although we conduct basic cleaning', 'Summary': 'by selecting the ground truth place object that has appeared the most often for a given user, this is only a heuristic and does not guarantee that the selected ground truth matches the description in the user location string, which introduces noise in the twitter-pug dataset.also, the current ground truth format does not account for alternative names in geolocation.A future direction is training the seq2seq model to generate multiple formal location names from a single user location string.Alternative names in gazetteers such as geonames could be used as a source of this ground truth.In figure 4, we identified several types of noise in twitter user profile locations.We did not conduct extensive data cleaning of fictional, joke, or non-existent locations.Though we attempted to filter these places automatically, we found little change in model performance.A more detailed study of the effects of data cleaning would be beneficial.Model size due to resource constraints, we only experiment with the mt5-small model.In a smallscale preliminary study, we found mt5 outperforms byt5 on our task of'}, {'Title': 'Model capabilities we observed that current lms struggle to generate', 'Summary': 'several categories of examples.Lms struggled to generate examples related to concepts they do not understand well.As discussed in §6, we also found that lms struggled to generate examples with many constraints, in particular, those in the bbq dataset.We expect these limitations to wane as lms grow more capable with scale.Lastly, many evaluations related to lm capabilities require the dataset creator to know how to solve the evaluation.We expect that lms will not be able to generate high-quality evaluations of this kind.Our approach is thus differentially useful for evaluating other properties of models aside from capabilities.Model biases lms learn biases from their training data , impacting the generator pg and discriminator pd.For example, generated evaluations may exhibit gender or racial biases and be lower quality for languages under-represented in the lm training data.Lms will also be systematically worse at generating evaluations for tasks that are omitted from their training data.Example diversity we found limited example diversity for some kinds of evaluations though not all.Diversity appears to depends on the kind of'}]\u001b[0m"

hence, for other languages and pos tag sets, a pattern template will need to be designed by referring to the feature templates of existing learning-based methods for the target language and pos tag set.Because the method jointly solves word segmentation and pos tagging in a left-to-right manner, patterns cannot leverage certain abstract features from posterior contexts of the target word.For application to other languages, it would be worthwhile to explore not only left-to-right processing but also right-to-left processing and a cascaded pipeline approach.Lemmatization the approach here currently requires a morphological dictionary with lemmas or a fine-grained pos tag set that includes conjugation types and forms to perform lemmatization.Because lemma generation rules for other languages can be induced from lemma-annotated datasets , the method could be applied to other languages by using such lemma generation rules as the target labels for classification.Challenging target languages include morphologically rich languages such as arabic and czech.\",\\n        \"This paper argues that the proposed task of ellipsisdependent reasoning is a difficult challenge for gpt-3 models, which are among the most powerful current language models.The data constructed here is restricted to english, and furthermore is restricted to a single form of ellipsis, namely verb phrase ellipsis.It may well be that other forms of ellipsis may give rise to different effects, and it is also important to test the claims made here on other languages.\",\\n        \"While we have improved the asymptotic running time of a classic algorithm with regard to grammar size, the time complexity of our algorithm is still cubic in the length of the input.Our result follows the tradition of dynamic programming algorithms that trade time for space by memoizing and reusing pre-computed intermediate results.The usefulness of this trade-off in practice depends on the specifics of the grammar, and while the complexity is strictly better in terms of non-terminals, it will be most noticeable for denser grammars with many nonterminals.\",\\n        \"One of the main limitations is that we used the standard liwc-based analysis approach, which is purely lexical and does not take into account the context in which a word appears.Consequently, many words that have very specific senses in the context of the ietf get miscounted as occurrences of liwc categories.This could be addressed by a more advanced method of mapping to liwc categories that would account for context.Another limitation is that we manually generated a filtering list containing words specific to the ietf.This list might not be exhaustive enough.Also, we were limited by not conducting an exhaustive hyper-parameter search on our models.We also understand that many emails are longer than 512 tokens and might have not been captured completely by our bert model.However, most of the emails do fit into this bert sequence length limit.We did not fine tune bert on the ietf data; this might have given better performance, although it is not clear if it would have given more insight: our main goal is not performance but analyzing/comparing characteristics of existing models.It is also worth highlighting that the data used in this work is strictly in english, and the psycholinguistic categories in liwc are also based on english language.Hence, this study may be biased and not fully capture variations in linguistic traits that are culturally agnostic.\",\\n        \"This paper mainly focuses on modelling basic meaning to identify metaphors, typically learning basic meanings from literal annotations of the vua dataset.However, our analysis reveals that the literal annotations of the vua dataset are incomplete, which means that some words in vua have no literal instances annotated.Although we propose using contextual word embeddings as a backup in this paper, another promising solution for this issue might be using external resources such as dictionaries.Leveraging dictionaries is commonly used to assist manual metaphor detection, so it could also help our basicmip mechanism to generalise.\"\\n    ],\\n    \\'text_length\\': [2736, 468, 563, 1980, 667],\\n    \\'Cluster\\': [6, 34, 22, 11, 13]\\n})\\ndf'}`\n",
