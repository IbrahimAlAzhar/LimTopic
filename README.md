# LimTopic: LLM-based Topic Modeling and Text Summarization for Analyzing Scientific Articles limitations

## Description:
This work uses various LLM with BERTopic to generate topics, titles, and relevant text in a scientific article's 'limitation' section. 
This work includes experiments, including Prompt Engineering, Fine-tuning LLM, BERTopic, and integrating various LLMs with BERTopic. Also, it includes text summarization with LLM to generate a very cohesive
'relevant text' of each topic.
